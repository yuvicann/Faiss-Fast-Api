## Implementing CRUD Operations with FAISS and FastAPI:
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of multimedia documents that are similar to each other.

Check Project_Details document for more information.

#### Important:
Create a Python module faiss_crud.py to manage the FAISS index and perform CRUD operations.

main.py for the Main Application.

pip install -r requirements.txt


#### Running Uvicorn Directly Using Python:
Ensure you are in the project directory:

cd (PATH)faiss_fastapi_project

python -m uvicorn main:app --reload


#### Setup Postman for CRUD Operations:

Postman is a software application that allows developers to test, document, and share APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
